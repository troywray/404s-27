Special section of training guidelines. 5 1/2 x  8 1/2, 45 pp. No published table of contents  Excerpt from page 9  Questions #7  How do you teach your horse to lead?  Answer:  I am going to tell you of two different ways to teach your horse to lead.  Put a halter and lead rope on the horse.  Have a big strong man take the lead rope (maybe you better have two men) and have them pull the horse forward with two big men behind pushing him.  If the men are big enough you might move him a little but you will get more resistance than cooperation.  I don't recommend this way, it is not the best way.  I quit using this method a long time ago.  Now I will tell you of a better way.  Put a halter and lead rope on the horse, stand off to the left side and pull his head lightly toward you immediately after saying come here.  Caress the horse for any cooperation he gives you even if he only turns his head slightly towards you.  Repeat this until he will follow you to the left.  Do the same thing to his right side and gradully diagonally forward.  And finally straight ahead, always caressing him for his obedience.  You may reward him with a tid bit.  Practice this again the next day.  It is best to do all of this in a small familiar pen so that his mind will be on you instead of his unfamiliar surroundings.","1362","7751","Farm and Livestock,,","20","Horse Behavior Problems Book","","28","0","Reviews","","7","0","","","https://www.lehmans.com/product/horse-behavior-problems-book/farm-books","123273","940","4.714892","0","3","248","7","c88ed25e09b2798417c887aaed100303","0.032","",""

All you need is sunshine.  When It's Hot - Your attic can get up to 150Â°F in the summer. This intense heat leaks through into the living area of your home, raising the temperature and making it uncomfortable. Our attic fan reduces attic temperatures 50Â°-60Â°F, preventing floors from warping, shingles from deteriorating prematurely, and decreasing cooling costs.  When It's Cold - Air circulation keeps moisture from condensing which can ruin rafters and floors or soak insulation, making it ineffective. Air movement stops ice dams from forming at the eaves by preventing overheating in the winter sun.  How It Works - When the sun shines the 12 fan moves 800 cfm of air out of your attic, pulling new air in at the eaves. Cut a hole on the south side of your roof, mount the fan, caulk the flashing (tube of 50-year silicone included), and tilt solar panel toward the sun. No wiring, no thermostat, no fire risk. Runs silently, only during the day when needed most, at no expense.  Highest Quality - Spun aluminum shroud and flashing means no leaks, no rust, no seams. Powder coated to withstand any environment, stainless steel animal screen and hardware. Pittman DC motor, BP solar panel, 5-year warranty. 10 watts, flashing 26OD, shroud 21OD. USA made.

ContentsIntroductionGrowing Your Own DillObtaining SeedsWhere, When, and How to PlantHarvesting and Preserving Your DillAppetizersSoupsMeat, Poultry, and FishEggs and CheesePasta and GrainsVegetables and SaladsPicklesBreadsSources for Dill Seeds    Excerpt from page 3 - Introduction I'm a firm believer that you can substitute almost any herb for almost any other herb in just about any recipe. Thus you can substitute oregano for marjoram, or even thyme for either of them.This, however, does not apply to dill. Its taste is simply too distinctive. When you want dill, you want dill! The only other herb this applies to is tarragon, which also has its own particular taste, unlike any other. On second thought, I'd have to add cilantro to the do not substitute list. Its flavor is certainly unique. Technically dill's name is Anethum graveolens. Two parts are used - the soft, leafy, fernlike leaves or fronds and the seeds. Somehow (and it's not hard to imagine how this can to be), the leafy part of the plant has come to be called dillweed. If I had to guess, I'd say that somewhere along the line someone decided that there should be a verbal distinction between the fronds and the seeds, and so we have dillweed and dill seeds.Luckily, dill is very easy to grow. I'll guide you through the planting of seeds, then take you on a tour of the growing season and give you some ideas for preserving your harvest. And then I'll give you a choice selection of dill-sparked recipes to try. I urge you to try all of them - they are extraordinary.

The distributors of our coffee pay a fair price to the farmer, trade directly with democratic co-ops, supply advanced credit and support sustainable agriculture. This means that the coffee costs a little more, but you get the cream of the crop while supporting farmers and their communities as they build lives based on dignity and hope.

All coffee we sell is certified organic by Oregon Tilth
Delicious and of the highest quality
All our coffees are blends of beans from Peru, Nicaragua, Mexico and Guatemala. Available in whole bean only.
